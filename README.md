# NVIDIA Stock Price Prediction Using Random Forest Model
This repository showcases the application of a Random Forest model for predicting NVIDIA's stock price. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into potential future price movements based on historical data and relevant financial indicators.

## Overview
As NVIDIA continues to lead in sectors like AI and gaming, accurate stock price predictions can help investors make informed decisions. The Random Forest model, known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, serves as the core of our analysis.

## Key Features
Historical Stock Data: Utilizes past price movements and trading volumes to form a solid foundation for predictions.
Financial Metrics: Integrates critical financial indicators such as earnings and revenue growth to assess company performance.
Market Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes social media trends and news sentiment to gauge public perception and its potential impact on stock prices.

## Methodology
Data Collection: Gather historical stock prices, financial metrics, and market sentiment data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Model Training: Implement the Random Forest algorithm using the training dataset.
Prediction and Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and predict future stock prices.

## Results
Preliminary analysis indicates a potential upward trend in NVIDIA's stock, driven by the ongoing demand for AI and gaming technologies. The insights generated from this model can serve as a valuable tool for investors.
